### Description
If you follow along with this tutorial, you will be able to press a hotkey whenever a Spotify commercial comes on and mute the player until the next song comes on!

**Aside:** Now, I have to say, somehow I feel guilty about this. Is it our responsibility to listen to commercials if they are what pay for our free music? I didn't know it was possible to feel guilty about this, but I guess my frustration of realizing I forgot to unmute my computer 10 minutes after a commercial comes on is getting the best of me. Plus, it's pretty stinking fun to figure this stuff out.

Anyway, here's the tutorial:

1. Clone the repository
2. Put the `commercial_muter.scpt` file somewhere safe where it can be referenced everytime you press your desired hotkey. (I put it in a folder I made called `AppleScripts` in my `Documents` directory)
3. Press âŒ˜ + Spacebar
4. Select "automator"
5. Select `Utilities` in your `Library`
6. Double click on `Run AplleScript` in the adjacent pane
7. Replace **ALL** of the text in the AppleScript box with the contents of the `sample-automator-applescript.txt` file included in this repository

then just follow common sense (jk)

to be continued...
